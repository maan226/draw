## TLS Plugin Deployement.
### Setup Guide

Unlike the usual setup use cases for EC, the TLS plugin can be used in scenarios where the connectivity between the EC Server agent and the data-source has to be encrypted. The most common use case is connecting to an end point ( data-source) using the "https" protocol over the port 443 instead of a regular "http" connection.
